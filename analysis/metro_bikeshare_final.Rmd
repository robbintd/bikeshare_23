Loading 2023 bikeshare ridership data (with lat/long location info):

```{r}

# Need to replace this data with bikeshare data for which the lat/long data isn't rounded to 2 decimals (1 km resolution):

thisfile=here("data_raw", "202309-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.zip")

df1=read_csv(thisfile) %>% clean_names()

```

Loading 2023 metro station information (with lat/long location info):

```{r}

# May need to replace this data with metro entrances/exits, because one metro station may have multiple exits far apart.

thisfile=here("data_raw", "Metro_Stations_Regional.csv")

df2=read_csv(thisfile) %>% clean_names()

```
